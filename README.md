# WinCopies Framework

**A comprehensive, cross-platform development toolkit with language-native implementations and shared design.**

WinCopies provides both general-purpose utilities (collections, typing, I/O) and specialized components (data abstraction, reflection). Each language implementation maintains API consistency while remaining fully native—no wrappers or bindings.

## Available Implementations

- **C#** – Full implementation
- **Python** – In development (this repository)
- **C++** – Planned

## Design Approach

The framework implements the same conceptual API independently in each language. Core types, method signatures, and behaviors are designed to be consistent across implementations, allowing developers to transfer knowledge and patterns between languages. Each implementation leverages its language's type system and performance characteristics while maintaining this semantic consistency.

## Key Packages

- **Collections** – Type-safe data structures with unified API
- **Data** – Database and structured data abstraction (RDBMS, etc. ; in development)
- **Typing** – Type utilities and reflection capabilities
- **I/O** – Input/output operations
- **GUI** *(planned)* – Graphical interface components
